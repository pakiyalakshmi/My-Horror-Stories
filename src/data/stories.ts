    content: `I was a child, I spent a lot of time alone. My parents lived in an old house way out in the countryside and there were no other children my age around. I had a little brother, but he was only a baby at the time, so I couldn't play with him. I was always a little lonely.

The old country house where we lived had a lot of small rooms. In the corridor, there was a closet with a sliding door where my father would store his tools. I loved to go in there and play with the tools. It was fun for me at the time.

One day, I found an old mirror at the back of the closet. It was an oval shape and the bronze frame was very ornate. Even though it was quite old and dusty, the glass was very clear and I could see myself perfectly.

One time, when I was playing in the closet, I happened to glance at the mirror and saw something that shocked me. In the reflection, I saw a strange girl standing behind me. Frightened, I turned around quickly, but there was nobody there. When I looked back at the mirror, I was confused. The little girl was still there.

I guess because I was a child, I wasn't scared of her. I just thought it was strange that she only appeared in the mirror. The little girl had long, dark hair and pale, white skin. Through the mirror, she looked at me and laughed.

"Hello," she said with a smile.

We started talking to each other. The girl told me to call her Nana. We would talk all the time. My parents must have wondered why I spent so much time in the closet talking to myself, but they never took the mirror away from me. It seemed that Nana-chan was not visible to adults.

One day, when I was talking to Nana-chan, I said, "I'm lonely. I wish I had some friends I could play with."

"Come over here and play with me," Nana-chan replied.

"I can go over there?" I asked. "How do I do that?"

Nana's face became troubled, then she lowered her voice. "I don't know," she whispered. "I'll ask…"

I wondered who she was going to ask, but all I could hear was silence. Somehow I felt like whoever it was, they didn't want me to listen.

The next day, when I spoke to Nana, she said happily, "I know how you can come over here now. Come on! Let's play!"

I was happy, but I remembered that my parents had always warned me that I had to tell them before I went anywhere.

"OK, but I'll have to ask my mother," I replied.

Nana's face became a little troubled again and she said, "Don't tell anyone about this. We may not be able to meet each other if you tell someone."

I stayed silent because I didn't want to disobey my parents.

Then Nana-chan said, "So you'll come and play with me tomorrow, OK? Promise?"

"Yeah," I replied, reluctantly. "I promise."

Nana reached out and touched the surface of the mirror with her little finger.

"Pinky swear?" she asked with a smile.

I reached out and pressed the tip of my little finger to the mirror beside hers.

"Pinky swear," I said. I thought I could feel a slight warmth through the glass.

That night, I didn't sleep very much. I didn't tell my parents about Nana-chan but as I lay there in the darkness, questions were swirling around in my head.

How would I enter into the mirror? What kind of place was it over there? Why wouldn't Nana come over here? If I went over there, how would I come back over here?

As I contemplated such things, I grew more and more anxious. I became a little scared of Nana-chan.

The next day, I didn't go to see Nana. I avoided her the day after that and the day after that. I didn't go near the closet all week. In fact, I never went into the closet again.

The weeks and months passed by quickly and I grew older. The months and years passed and I grew up. I left home to go to high school in the town. After I graduated, I started working in a nearby town. I didn't go home very much. Eventually, I met a girl and we got married. By that time, I had forgotten all about Nana.

Shortly after we got married, my wife found out she was pregnant.

She went to visit her parents for a while. I was all alone in the house, so I sometimes visited my own parents for dinner. They still lived in the same house.

One night, I decided to stay over and slept in my old bedroom. In the middle of the night, I woke up and went to use the toilet. While I was washing my hands, I happened to glance in the mirror. A sliding door in the middle of the corridor was open. It was the closet where I had played as a child. I thought the door had been closed when I went to the toilet.

I turned around and was shocked to see that the door was closed after all. However, when I looked back at the mirror, the door was open. A chill went down my spine and my hands began to shake. I thought I saw the door sliding back slightly in the darkness.

At that moment, I remembered Nana-chan.

I was overcome by fear, but it impossible to tear my eyes away from the mirror. The door was moving after all… in the mirror's reflection.

A white mist was floating across the darkness at the back of the closet. As I stared, it formed into a familiar face. The smiling face of Nana-chan. I think I must have fainted.

The next thing I remember was waking up on the floor. It was morning and my parents were still in bed.

"It must have been a dream," I told myself. "Just a creepy dream."

I wasn't comfortable staying in my parents' house, so after breakfast, I went back to my own home.

My apartment has an underground parking lot, so I pulled into my reserved space and parked the car. Just as I was about to get out, I glanced in the rearview mirror and did a double-take.

There, in the mirror, was the face of Nana.

I looked back in surprise, but there was no one in the back seat. I looked back at the rearview mirror and Nana-chan was still there. She was staring at me over my shoulder and our eyes met.

She looked exactly the same. The long, dark hair, the pale white skin. In all that time, nothing had changed. I was trembling and I couldn't take my eyes off her. Eventually, Nana laughed.

"Hello," she said with a smile.

I felt like I was going to be sick.

"Why didn't you come back that time?" she asked. "All this time, I've been waiting for you."

I was silent. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't find the words.

"Hey," she said. "Come over here and let's play from now on…"

In the reflection, her hand slowly stretched out towards me.

"Let's play here forever…" she said.

"It's no good!" I screamed. I didn't mean to say it so loud. "Nana-chan I'm sorry, I can't go over there. I won't go!"

Nana was silent and her hand stopped in mid-air.

Trembling, I grasped the door handle with all my strength and spoke in a small voice, like the little boy I had been long ago.

"I have a wife now… we're having a baby soon… So… I can't…"

I ended up at a loss for words with my head in my hands. I was shaking and shivering uncontrollably and eventually, I looked up at the mirror.

Nana-chan was still there.

"I see," she said, "you became an adult… and you don't want to play with me anymore…"

Her voice sounded so sad and lonely.

"I can't…" I said.

Nana-chan laughed and smiled. It seemed like such an innocent smile. At that moment, I really thought Nana-chan would forgive me for breaking our promise.

"Nana-chan…" I began, but she cut me off.

"If you won't play with me, I'll just have to find someone else," she said. "Someone just like you."

And then, suddenly, she was gone. Before I could fully understand her last words, she was gone. Once and for all. Nana never appeared to me again.

That evening my wife called me to tell me she had suffered a miscarriage. Our baby was dead.

Then, I finally understood what Nana-chan meant when she said, "someone just like you."`

    content: `There are all kinds of shocking videos on the internet, showing people doing sick, disgusting and horrific things. For some reason, people watch the videos and then post their reactions on Youtube. Perhaps you've heard of some of the shock videos.

They usually have weird titles like: 3 Guys 1 Crowbar, 2 Girls 1 Poop and 1 Man 1 Cactus.

I've watched every one of them, but today I watched one video that is more disturbing than all of the rest put together.

The title of the video is: 1 Guy 2 Spoons.

You're probably already wondering what it's about, but let me assure you, it's far more disgusting than anything you can think up. It shows a man using 2 spoons to pop out his eyeballs. Yes, that's right. He actually digs in behind his own eyeballs and pops them out of his head using the spoons.

When I watched the video, I was so disturbed by it that I almost threw up. As sickening as the video was, I forced myself to watch it to the end. I wish I hadn't.

Here's a good piece of advice for you: Be careful what you watch, because that which you see can never be unseen.

When the video was over, I heard my mom calling me from downstairs, telling me that dinner was ready. I raced downstairs and took a seat at the kitchen table. My father was reading the newspaper. My mother was setting the table.

"That's odd," my father remarked. "This article claims there's a new viral video going around on the internet. They say it's dangerous. Apparently, it causes anyone who sees it to go insane and try to pop out their own eyeballs…"

My father broke off and looked up.

"Oh my God!" my mother screamed and fainted. "Oh my God! What have you done?" My father, with high peak of tension and with fear, approached me.

But it was already too late.

I could feel the spoons in my hands, but I couldn't see a thing. Because my eyeballs are in the spoons of my hand.`

    content: `A 19-year old girl was attending university in Japan. In her second year of study, she decided that she wanted to improve her English, so she transferred to a university in the United States. She had always wanted to live in the USA, but she did not anticipate how difficult the change would be for her.

The course she was studying required her to submit a lot of reports. While she was attending the university in Japan, she submitted all her reports in Japanese. However, in the American university, all of the reports had to be in English. This caused a big problem for the girl because her command of the English language was not very good. She found that she had to spend hours upon hours checking the spelling and grammar, while typing up her reports.

Another problem was that she didn't own a laptop. Luckily, the university library had a computer lab with approximately 50 computers that was open 24 hours a day. Unfortunately, there were always long queues of people waiting to use them. Every morning, she had to attend lectures and, every evening, she had to queue for a computer. This all took its toll and, after a while, the girl became fed up with the daily grind.

Late one night, after the Japanese girl had been sitting over a computer for hours, she began to get restless. It was almost 2 AM and she was extremely tired. It was getting difficult for her to keep her eyes open. Leaning back in her chair, she yawned and stretched out her arms in front of her. Her fingers happened to nudge the computer keyboard aside.

She was about to begin typing again when she happened to glance down and noticed a bit of paper, that there was something scratched into the desk under the keyboard. It seemed to be an Internet URL. She thought it was odd that someone had taken the time to find a Website address. With curiosity and boredom, she decided to look it up.

After typing the website address into the browser, she waited a few seconds and a page appeared on the screen. What she saw horrified her.

There was a picture of man covered in blood, lying on the floor of a dimly-lit room. It looked so real that it turned her stomach and made her feel like throwing up. Looking closely, she saw a caption below the image.

It read: "Dumb guy, aged around 30. Killed by me today."

A chill went down her spine as she stared at the gruesome picture.

The girl immediately shut down her computer and, grabbing her handbag, she hurried out of the computer lab. She returned to her dorm room alone and spent the night tossing and turning in bed. The horrible photo she had seen was never far from her mind.

"Could it be real?" she asked herself. Maybe it's just a imagination. People post crazy pictures on the Internet all the time. The Web is full of weird and disturbing Websites.

The next morning, after breakfast, her curiosity got the better of her. She skipped her first lecture and headed straight for the computer labs. When she found a free computer, she sat down, typed in the URL and held her breath. Perhaps what she had seen last night was just her imagination.

When the Website appeared, she saw that the image had changed. Instead of a dead body in a dimly-lit room, the photo showed a blond woman walking down a busy street. The girl breathed a sigh of relief. The picture appeared to have been taken from a distance and the woman seemed unaware that she was being photographed.

The caption underneath read: "Stupid woman, around 25 years old."

That evening, the girl went back to her dorm room and didn't speak to anyone. She was still unnerved and couldn't stop thinking about the strange website. As soon as she woke up the next morning, she dressed and went back to the computer lab.

There was hardly anyone around. She sat down at a free computer and typed in the website URL. To her horror, the image had changed again. It was the same dimly-lit room, but this time a blond woman lay on the floor. Blood was flowing from her nose and mouth. There was a large knife sticking out of her chest.

The photo were the words: "Stupid woman, around 25 years old. Killed by me today."

The girl was horrified and immediately contacted the police. Over the phone, it was difficult for her to explain the situation. Her English was not very good and she spent a long time repeating herself and trying to find the right words to describe what she had found. in the end, she wasn't even sure if the police had understood what she was trying to say. However, they took her name, address, phone number and the URL of the Website.

When she hung up the phone, the girl was shaking. She couldn't seem to get the awful pictures out of her mind. She had to take another look. That evening, she returned to the computer lab again and, with mixed feelings of fear and curiosity, she entered the URL of the website.

When the page loaded, she discovered that the image that had been there just a few hours before, was gone. Instead, there was a picture of a girl, taken from behind. She had short, black hair, a lime-green t-shirt and was sitting in front of a computer.

The girl got a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach and she broke out into a cold sweat. She recognized the hair. She recognized the clothes. She was staring at a picture of herself.

Her name, address and phone number were written under the picture, followed by a single sentence:

"You are my next internet star…"

The Japanese girl ran out of the computer lab and went straight back to her dorm room. She packed up her belongings and, by the next morning, she was on a flight back to Japan. She never returned to the United States again.`

    content: `One night, a man had a nightmare. It was the most frightening thing he had ever experienced. In the dream, he found himself walking in a desert. Somehow, he had no idea how he had gotten there, but he knew he was lost and alone.

When he looked down, he realized he was carrying a machete in his hand. The long, cold steel blade looked razor-sharp. The sun was beating down and the heat was intense. The man was sweating profusely, but he kept walking, even though he had no idea where he was going.

After some time, he saw a dark figure crouching down in the distance. As he approached, he saw that it was a person, lying in the sand. He had been feeling extemely lonely, so he was grateful to see another human being. He quickly ran up to the man and bent over to help him up.

However, when he turned the man over, he took one look at his face and recoiled in horror.

He was looking at himself.

In that instant, he was so overcome with fear that he raised the machete above his head and, without thinking, hacked the man to death.

Horrified by what he had just done, he dropped the weapon and started running through the desert, trying to get away as far away from the place as possible. With every step, his feet sank further into the sand, but he kept on going, driven by terror and panic.

Eventually, he stumbled and fell to the ground. Lying in the sand, he realized that he had sprained his ankle. He couldn't walk another step. There was nothing he could do except lie there where he had fallen.

After a while, he looked up and saw something in the distance. It was the figure of a man, approaching across the wide expanse of desert. As the man approached, he waited until he could see his face clearly.

To his horror, he realized it was himself and in his hand, he was carrying a razor-sharp machete…`

    content: `There was a young girl named Abi who was very fond of classical music. She really wanted to learn how to play the piano and pestered her parents to pay for lessons. Her parents were not very well off, but they wanted to encourage their daughter's interest in music. They searched around and eventually found an old piano that was being sold for a very reasonable price.

The piano was delivered to their house and Abi was delighted. She immediately sat down and began pressing the keys. Her parents arranged for a piano teacher to come to the house once a week and give her lessons. Abi practiced diligently every day and gradually began to improve.

However, there was something strange about the piano. Sometimes, late at night, Abi would wake up and hear music coming from downstairs. When she went to investigate, she found the piano playing by itself. The keys were moving up and down, but there was nobody sitting at the piano bench.

At first, Abi was frightened, but after a while, she got used to it. The music was always beautiful and haunting. She began to look forward to hearing it. Sometimes, she would sit on the stairs and listen to the ghostly concert until she fell asleep.

One night, while she was listening to the phantom piano player, she noticed something odd. There were dark stains appearing on the keys. As she watched, they spread and began to drip onto the floor. It looked like blood.

The next day, Abi asked her parents about the history of the piano. They made some inquiries and discovered that it had belonged to a young woman who was murdered. She had been practicing the piano late one night when an intruder broke into her house. The killer had stabbed her repeatedly and she had bled to death, right there at the piano.

That night, Abi waited until everyone was asleep and then crept downstairs. She sat down at the piano and began to play. As she played, she felt a cold presence behind her. In the reflection of the polished wood, she could see a figure standing there. It was the ghost of a young woman, covered in blood.

The ghost reached out and placed her hands on Abi's shoulders. Her touch was ice cold. Then, she began to guide Abi's hands across the keys, teaching her to play a beautiful but mournful melody. From that night on, the ghost became Abi's teacher, and she learned to play better than she ever had before.

Years later, when Abi grew up, she became a famous concert pianist. She still has the old piano and sometimes, late at night, she can still hear it playing by itself. The ghost of the murdered woman is still there, still teaching, still playing her haunting melodies in the dark of night.`

    content: `It was a gloomy, cloudy night. Shiva was a handsome young man between the age of 25 – 28. He was very busy with his investigation of two retired police officers who had been missing for the last 2 months one after the other. Their age ranged between 55 to 60. Shiva was seriously examining the pieces of evidence which were collected on the spot. The men's boot was the evidence. It was found at the place where both policemen were found at last. At the time Mr. Shiva heard a creeping voice.

"Sir, I am a murderer."

She was trembling while saying this. She was sitting in the police station, opposite Shiva's table. She was there to surrender herself. He was shocked. She was a beautiful lady of about 22 or 23 years, had long hair which was maintained nicely, wearing a pink shirt and dark blue jeans.

She had sunglasses on her eyes. She was looking from a wealthy and rich family.

"Who did you kill?"

He asked her after a long pause because her first sentence was not expected or if he talk frankly, he was lost in her beauty.

"I have killed 3 people."

Shiva was really surprised to hear that. A girl, so pretty, can kill 3 people and also commit it in front of police. The whole thing was a bit unusual for him.

"I have killed my Gardner, my driver, and" She paused a bit and started to sob. "And my mother." She started crying hard. Shiva gave her water and she began to take a sip from that glass.

When she controlled her emotions, she continued to talk.

"Please I beg of you, please arrest me otherwise I will kill someone else also."

"Why did you kill them and why will you kill others? Ma'am, What's your name?"

"Shilpa." She was still sobbing.

"Shilpa, why did you kill them?"

"I don't know. It just happened automatically."

"Shilpa, I am not getting it. And I cannot arrest you without any complaint and without seeing the body of the dead people you are talking about." She was looking very tense to him. So he continued, "Shilpa, where are the bodies?"

"I dug them in my garden."

She was not looking fake but what she was saying was hard to believe.

Shiva decided to go to her house. He took two constables also with him. When they reached her house she guided them to her garden and told them the places where the bodies of the gardener and driver were dug. He commanded the constables to take the bodies out.

"Where's the body of your mother?" Shiva asked Shilpa.

"She is inside."

He started to follow Shilpa. She took him inside the house and then stopped in front of a dark room.

"Inside. My mother is lying inside." She started to cry again.

He slowly started to move inside the room. The room was so dark that it was difficult to see anything. Shiva had one torch with him so he decided to turn that on. He searched the whole room but the room was empty.

Then he saw one room which was closed.

Shiva opened that room and was shocked to see that three bodies were lying inside the room. Two men may be Shilpa's gardener and driver and one old lady maybe her mother.

Shiva was wondering why Shilpa told him that bodies were out there in the garden.

After pointing the torch at those bodies Shiva came to know that those two bodies were the missing Policeman and one unidentified old lady. But it was not her mother.

"Ahhhhhh" Someone stabbed him from behind.

He turned around. He was shocked to see Shilpa standing with a knife in her right hand covered with his blood.

"Why?"

he asked her in a trembling voice.

She came closer to him and stabbed him in his stomach and said,

"Because, it's fun."

He fell to the ground and she took his gun and rushed outside. He heard two fires. She killed Shiva's constables also.

Shiva saw her last image standing in front of the mirror, combing her hair and singing a song.........

"It's just for fun.
And for relief!
But it's a wanted motive."`
